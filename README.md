DESCRIPTION:
The Hex Game project is a implementation of the classic board game featuring clear architecture and separation of functionalities. It includes three AI strategies, client-server communication, and concurrency management. The design emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and robustness, with a focus on ensuring thread safety through synchronization mechanisms. Testing encompasses both system tests and JUnit tests.

HEX GAME RULES:
Hex is a strategic board game for two players. The game is played on a hexagonal grid, typically
of size 11x11 or 13x13, though the size can vary. The traditional colors are red and blue.
The objective of Hex is to form a path of your pieces that connects the opposing sides of the
hexagonal board marked by your colors before your opponent does. In the programming project,
we play on a 9x9 board
